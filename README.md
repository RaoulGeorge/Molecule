# Molecule

##Summary
This is a personal project of mine using all the lessons learned through several years of professional web development experience. Molecule is a front-end ecosystem consisting of framework agnostic code, tooling and tests.

##External Libs
* Requirejs
* jQuery

##Patterns

##Naming Conventions

###Prototype Methods
All prototype methods are named Object_methodname. This is done to allow for easier debugging instead of using anonymous functions. See below -:

`Composer.prototype.addScaffolding = function Composer_addScaffolding() {};`
